2. Sender's Email Address Analysis:
Email: support@amaz0n-security.com
Issue: Spoofed domain; "amaz0n" instead of "amazon".


3. Email Headers
Use a tool like Google Header Analyzer
Look for:
Mismatch between Return-Path and From address
Unusual IP origin (e.g., not belonging to Amazon's range)


4. Suspicious Links/Attachments
Link Text: https://amaz0n.verify-user-security.com/login
Real URL: Not actually amazon.com — looks suspicious.
Red Flag: Domain designed to look legit but is fake.


5. Urgent or Threatening Language
Phrases like:
"Your account will be suspended immediately"
"Failure to do so will result in permanent suspension"


6. Mismatched URLs
Hovering over the link shows a different URL than what’s written.
Example: Written URL appears official but actually redirects to phishing site.


7.Spelling and Grammar Errors
Minor grammatical oddities:
“click the link below” not capitalized
"verify-user-security" — unprofessional phrasing
